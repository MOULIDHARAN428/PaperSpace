## 💡 Inspiration
- Academic piracy is said to be on the rise according to the Bookseller article.
- On average, academic publishers ‘lose over 28% of their potential revenue to piracy’ (Jones, 2019) and with technology vastly developing and pirate search engines such as LibGen and SciHub thriving in this digital era, this number is only going to go up.

## 💻 What it does
- PaperGram is a web based application , which is made  using blockchain technology(web 3.0) ,  to safeguard user publications in the research field.
- We are using blockchain to create a secure and decentralized platform for researchers, who want to publish their research safely

## ⚙️ How we built it
- React has been used as client end framework for the development of Papergram.
- We developed the custom  smart contracts  utilising and deployed it on the Polygon Mumbai Test Net utilising  for its speed and scalability.
- To keep the hashes of the paper pdf and its brochure, we utilised web3.storage.
- We have stored research papers and paper boucher in web3 storage which is an IPFS

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into
- Writing smart contracts and deploying our project in the Polygon testnet were a couple of the challenges we faced
- Finishing the project in the allotted time was a major hassle as we were planning to make it feature rich as possible with the limited time period.

## 🚀 What's next for PaperGram
- Enhanced paper recommendation system using Ml models from the favourites section.
- Subscription models to benefit the creators who are the publishers with necessary profits.
- Directly publish the papers from Locker which holds the paper securely making the process even more easier and efficient.
- Collaboration with various publishing websites such as major journal publishing  companies can be a major game changer and make piracy stop once and for all.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We're glad to sucessfully complete this project!
- The end goal was met to a satisfactory level, and the outcome would allow everyone to be uploaded papers securely.
